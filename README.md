# StonkBot
 A discord bot to track changes in Hypixel Skyblock's Bazaar and Auction House

This is a program I have written that runs as a Python file (run it with a proper bot key and it'll run itself).

I made most of this in a few hours late at night (from something like 10 PM to 4 AM?) so unfortunately it is sparsely commented! Hopefully the variable names and function names are understandable.

It has the following commands:
You must have the role STONK TRADER to run these commands unless otherwise noted.

Bazaar:
$sendgraph <key> [OPTIONAL Past Time: any integer, default = 3600] [OPTIONAL filter: -b] - Returns a graph with the price overtime for an item
     E.g. $sendgraph diamond - Returns a graph showing bazaar pricing for diamonds for the past hour.
$upcrafts [OPTIONAL: mode (%,upvalue,ppi)] - Returns all profitable upcrafts (Bazaar moves super fast so be sure to check right before you buy!!!)
$disparity - Returns the difference between the sell instantly price and the buy instantly price for each sitem (as text file)
$post_here - StonkBot will start to output bazaar changes to the channel in which the command was sent. Must have role STONK MASTER

Auction House
$value [OPTIONAL filter: -v (verbose), -a (list all), -h <enchantment> (has enchantment)] <item name> - Returns average selling value of item from the AH. Taken from auctions in the last 10 seconds before they finished.
     E.g. $value aspect of the dragons - returns the average selling value of an aspect of the dragons
$trackeditems - Returns a txt file containing all items with data registered from the AH.
$enchbook "<enchantment> <level> etc." - You can repeat enchantment/level as much as you want for as many enchantments with levels. Returns the data for all enchanted books with the enchantments and levels you provided.
$ah_post_here - StonkBot will start to output underpriced AH auctions to the channel in which the command was sent. Must have role STONK MASTER.
